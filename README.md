# Git Update All Repos Bash Script

This script updates all Git repositories within a given directory or path. It can be easily aliased in a shell profile for quick execution. What sets this script apart is its ability to safely handle local changes by stashing them before switching branches and pulling the latest changes, helping avoid merge conflicts and making repository updates smoother.
